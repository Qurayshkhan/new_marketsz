            <p dir="ltr">When you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the
                form of cookies. This information might be about you, your preferences
                or your
                device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to. Usually the information does not
                identify you directly, but it can give you a more personalized web
                experience.<br><br>The following types of cookies may be used on our website:</p>
            <p dir="ltr"><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong></p>
            <p dir="ltr">These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our
                systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which
                amount to a
                request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set
                your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some
                parts of the
                site will then not work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.</p>
            <p dir="ltr"><strong>Tracking cookies</strong></p>
            <p dir="ltr">These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources, so we can measure and improve the
                performance of our site. They help us know which pages are the most and
                least popular
                and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore
                anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies, we will not know when

                to our
                pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly.</p>
            <p dir="ltr"><strong>Targeting and advertising cookies</strong></p>
            <p dir="ltr">Targeting cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They can be used by

                information they collect from you, which includes uniquely identifying your browser and terminal equipment.
                If you do not allow these cookies you will still see basic
                advertising on your
