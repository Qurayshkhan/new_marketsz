            <h4>About these Terms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect
                    changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the
                    terms
                    regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified
                    additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply
                    retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However,
                    changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for
                    legal reasons
                    will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should
                    discontinue your use of our Services.</li>
                <li>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control
                    for that conflict.</li>
                <li>These terms control the relationship between MyMalls.com and you. They do not create any third party
                    beneficiary rights.</li>
                <li>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we
                    are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in
                    the future).
                </li>
                <li>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</li>
            </ul>
